# BloomFilter

1) Please see BloomFilter.h for documentation, and discussion of assumptions and future work.
2) The BloomFilterCpp project is configured to create a LIB that can be included to any project.
3) BloomFilterCppTest produces a DLL, and uses the Microsoft C++ UT Framework.
4) BloomFilterCppTest serves the dual purpose of (a) consuming the filter to demonstrate its use, and (b) to test the filter.
